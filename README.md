Hey, I’m Aditya 👋

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at NYU with a background in information security, backend systems, and applied ML. I enjoy building scalable systems, experimenting with modern AI models, and turning half-baked ideas into working products.

Currently focused on backend engineering, cloud-native systems, and ML-driven applications.
